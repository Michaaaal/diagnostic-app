**DiagnoseYourself**    <br>               **link:** https://diagnostic-app-deploy.onrender.com/ <br><br>

The application diagnoses the user based on provided symptoms and user data (such as age, weight, etc.), <br> 
then presents a set of potential ailments with possible treatment strategies. <br><br>

The application follows a hybrid architecture combining traditional **MVC** with **REST API**. It uses server-side<br>
rendered views, where data is passed through model attributes for rendering the frontend, while asynchronous<br>
data fetching is handled via REST endpoints. The project is modular, with packages organized by functionality<br>
(e.g., auth, diagnosePart, dataPart, core), ensuring separation of concerns.<br><br>
